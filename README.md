# FlockSimulation
FlockSimulation is my final project at Computer graphics class in POSTECH, Korea. The project was voted as the best demo at my class. 
The project was inspired by Craig Reynolds 3D implementation (1986) and Mat Bucland's 2D implementation
My implementation was in C++ with OpenGL. No other libraries or softwares are required to run.
